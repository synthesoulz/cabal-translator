# cabal-translator

Just a small python script with a dictionary that has mappings of the words of the Cabal language from Blood. You can find the original article here
https://blood-wiki.org/index.php/Cultist_Language

The dictionary was words and phrases that were more audible than the "fan translations" as such, two scripts were created one containing known words which produces more realistic results and then you have the goofy version which pretty much babbles nonsense. 
I am not sure if this translator still works or will ever work again, but it's worth mentioning the inspiration:
